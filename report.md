# Present analysis, problems, and potential solutions
## What We’ve Done So Far

We’ve built a DQN model to teach an agent how to drive autonomously, likely in a racing or navigation simulation. Here’s what we’ve implemented:

### The Model Architecture
Here’s the code for our neural network:
```python
def _build_model(self):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(24, input_dim=self.state_size, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(24, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(self.action_size, activation='linear'))
    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001))
    return model
```
- **Structure**: It’s a simple three-layer network with 24 neurons in the input layer (ReLU activation), 24 in the hidden layer (ReLU), and an output layer matching the number of actions (3) with linear activation.
- **Purpose**: The output layer provides Q-values for actions like “turn left,” “turn right,” or “go straight,” and we select the action with the highest Q-value.

We’re wondering if ReLU might be holding us back. Could switching to Tanh or LeakyReLU improve how the model learns?

### Action Selection
Here’s how we’re choosing actions:
```python
def act(self, state, explore_rate=0.0):
    if np.random.rand() <= explore_rate:
        return random.randrange(self.action_size)
    state_tensor = np.array(state).reshape(1, self.state_size)
    act_values = self.model.predict(state_tensor, verbose=0)
    return np.argmax(act_values[0])
```
- **Epsilon-Greedy**: We use an epsilon-greedy approach—random actions when a random number is below epsilon (exploration), otherwise the model predicts and picks the best action (exploitation).
- **Epsilon Decay**: Epsilon starts at 1.0, decays by 0.995 each step, and stops at 0.01.

We’re curious if tweaking epsilon decay or exploring other selection methods could help the model discover better strategies.

### Experience Replay
Here’s our replay function:
```python
def replay(self, batch_size):
    if len(self.memory) < batch_size:
        return
    minibatch = random.sample(self.memory, batch_size)
    states = np.array([experience[0] for experience in minibatch])
    actions = np.array([experience[1] for experience in minibatch])
    rewards = np.array([experience[2] for experience in minibatch])
    next_states = np.array([experience[3] for experience in minibatch])
    dones = np.array([experience[4] for experience in minibatch])
    
    targets = self.model.predict(states_tensor, verbose=0)
    next_q_values = self.target_model.predict(next_states_tensor, verbose=0)
    
    for i in range(batch_size):
        if dones[i]:
            targets[i][actions[i]] = rewards[i]
        else:
            targets[i][actions[i]] = rewards[i] + GAMMA * np.amax(next_q_values[i])
    
    self.model.fit(states_tensor, targets, epochs=1, verbose=0)
    self.training_count += 1
    
    if self.epsilon > EPSILON_MIN:
        self.epsilon *= EPSILON_DECAY
```
- **How It Works**: We store experiences in a replay buffer, sample a random batch, and update Q-values using the Bellman equation—reward alone if done, or reward plus discounted future Q-value if not.

We’ve been thinking about whether adjusting the reward calculation, like using SARSA, could refine the model’s behavior.

## Problems We’ve Encountered

The model’s functioning, but it’s not progressing as much as we’d hoped. Here’s what’s happening:
- **Plateauing Rewards**: The rewards are stagnant—it avoids crashes but repeats the same steps.
- **Limited Exploration**: Epsilon drops to 0.01 quickly, favoring exploitation over exploration.
- **Local Maximum**: It’s stuck in a “safe” but suboptimal strategy.
- **Small Network**: 24 neurons per layer might not capture the environment’s complexity.
- **Overestimated Q-Values**: The DQN might be too optimistic about certain actions.

It feels like the model’s in a rut, and we need to nudge it toward better performance.

## Potential Solutions

To tackle the challenges we’ve identified in our reinforcement learning model, we’re exploring a range of solutions. Each is tailored to address one or more of the specific problems we’ve encountered. Below, I’ll dive deep into each solution, explaining what it entails, why it’s a promising approach, and how it directly mitigates the issues we’re facing.

### 1. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **What We’ll Do**: Fine-tune key hyperparameters, including:
  - **Epsilon Decay Rate**: Slow it from 0.995 to 0.997 per step.
  - **Minimum Epsilon**: Increase from 0.01 to 0.05.
  - **Learning Rate**: Decrease from 0.001 to 0.0005.
- **Why It Helps**:
  - **Slower Epsilon Decay**: In the epsilon-greedy strategy, epsilon controls the balance between exploration (trying random actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action). A faster decay (e.g., 0.995) reduces epsilon quickly, causing the model to shift to exploitation early in training. Slowing it to 0.997 keeps epsilon higher for longer, extending the exploration phase. This gives the agent more time to sample a diverse set of actions and states, increasing the chances of discovering high-reward strategies.
  - **Higher Minimum Epsilon**: Once epsilon reaches its minimum, the model retains that level of randomness indefinitely. Raising it from 0.01 (1% random actions) to 0.05 (5% random actions) ensures that even late in training, the agent occasionally explores new possibilities rather than locking into a fixed policy. This sustained exploration can prevent the model from fixating on a suboptimal strategy.
  - **Lower Learning Rate**: The learning rate determines the step size of updates to the Q-values. A high rate (e.g., 0.001) can cause large, erratic updates, potentially overshooting optimal solutions or destabilizing training. Reducing it to 0.0005 makes updates smaller and more precise, allowing the model to refine its policy gradually and converge more reliably.
- **How It Solves Each Problem**:
  - **Plateauing Performance**: By extending exploration and refining updates, the model is less likely to settle into a mediocre policy prematurely, pushing performance beyond current limits.
  - **Lack of Exploration**: Slower decay and a higher minimum epsilon directly increase the frequency and duration of random action selection, broadening the agent’s experience.
  - **Stuck in a Local Maximum**: Prolonged and sustained exploration provides more opportunities to encounter actions that lead out of suboptimal regions of the reward landscape.
  - **Q-Value Overestimation**: A lower learning rate can mitigate overestimation indirectly by preventing large updates based on noisy or overly optimistic Q-values, though this is a secondary effect.
  - **Small Network Capacity, Limited Action Space, Small Replay Buffer**: While not directly addressing these, better exploration and learning dynamics can maximize the use of existing capacity and data.

### 2. Double DQN
- **What We’ll Do**: Implement Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN), which uses two neural networks: one for selecting actions (the online network) and a separate target network for evaluating Q-values, updated less frequently.
- **Why It Helps**:
  - **Reduces Q-Value Overestimation**: In standard DQN, the same network selects and evaluates the maximum Q-value for the next state, leading to a bias toward overestimating values (the “maximization bias”). For example, if noise in the Q-values makes a suboptimal action appear better, the model amplifies this error. Double DQN decouples these steps: the online network picks the action, and the target network evaluates it, providing a more grounded estimate. This reduces the tendency to chase inflated Q-values.
  - **Improves Stability**: By using a slowly updated target network, the Q-value targets change less frequently, reducing oscillations in training and helping the model converge more smoothly.
  - **Encourages Broader Exploration**: More accurate Q-values mean the agent is less likely to overcommit to a narrow set of “overly optimistic” actions, indirectly promoting consideration of alternatives.
- **How It Solves Each Problem**:
  - **Q-Value Overestimation**: Directly addresses this by breaking the maximization bias, leading to more realistic action-value estimates.
  - **Plateauing Performance**: More accurate Q-values can guide the agent toward genuinely better strategies, avoiding stagnation due to misleading evaluations.
  - **Stuck in a Local Maximum**: By reducing overestimation, the model may assign higher values to previously underexplored actions, helping it escape suboptimal policies.
  - **Lack of Exploration**: While not a direct fix, better Q-value estimates can make exploration (via epsilon-greedy) more effective by ensuring random actions are evaluated fairly.
  - **Small Network Capacity, Limited Action Space, Small Replay Buffer**: Doesn’t directly address these, but enhances the effectiveness of the current architecture and data.

### 3. Huber Loss
- **What We’ll Do**: Replace Mean Squared Error (MSE) with Huber loss as the loss function for training the Q-network.
- **Why It Helps**:
  - **Robustness to Outliers**: MSE penalizes large errors quadratically, which can destabilize training if the environment produces occasional extreme rewards or penalties (e.g., a large negative reward for crashing). Huber loss acts like MSE for small errors (smooth gradient) and like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for large ones (linear penalty), reducing the impact of outliers.
  - **Balanced Learning**: It combines the sensitivity of MSE for fine-tuning with the stability of MAE for handling noise, making it well-suited for environments with variable or unpredictable rewards.
  - **Smoother Convergence**: By dampening the effect of extreme updates, Huber loss helps the model adjust Q-values more consistently, avoiding erratic swings that could derail training.
- **How It Solves Each Problem**:
  - **Plateauing Performance**: Stable training can prevent the model from stalling due to erratic updates, allowing steady improvement.
  - **Q-Value Overestimation**: Indirectly helps by reducing the influence of outlier rewards that might inflate Q-values, though Double DQN is a more direct fix.
  - **Lack of Exploration, Stuck in a Local Maximum**: Smoother updates can keep the model learning effectively, making it less likely to get trapped or overly reliant on a narrow policy, though this is secondary.
  - **Small Network Capacity**: A more stable loss function can maximize the learning potential of a smaller network by ensuring updates are meaningful.
  - **Limited Action Space, Small Replay Buffer**: Doesn’t directly address these, but improves training efficiency within existing constraints.

### 4. Action Space Enhancement
- **What We’ll Do**: Expand the discrete action space from 3 actions (e.g., accelerate, turn left, turn right) to 4 by adding a “BRAKE” action.
- **Why It Helps**:
  - **Increased Control Granularity**: In tasks like autonomous driving, the ability to slow down or stop can be critical for avoiding obstacles, navigating turns, or responding to sudden changes. Without a “BRAKE,” the agent might be forced to choose between risky acceleration or suboptimal steering, limiting its options.
  - **Broader Strategic Flexibility**: More actions mean more possible combinations and sequences, enabling the agent to develop nuanced policies. For instance, braking before a sharp turn could yield higher rewards than accelerating through it.
  - **Better Adaptation**: An extra action allows the agent to adapt to a wider range of scenarios, potentially uncovering strategies that were inaccessible with only 3 actions.
- **How It Solves Each Problem**:
  - **Limited Action Space**: Directly expands the action set, giving the agent more tools to interact with the environment.
  - **Plateauing Performance**: New actions can unlock higher-reward strategies, pushing performance beyond current plateaus.
  - **Stuck in a Local Maximum**: Additional options provide pathways out of suboptimal policies, as the agent can now try braking instead of persisting with less effective actions.
  - **Lack of Exploration**: While exploration itself isn’t increased, a larger action space makes random exploration (via epsilon) more fruitful by offering more possibilities to sample.
  - **Q-Value Overestimation, Small Network Capacity, Small Replay Buffer**: Doesn’t directly address these, but a richer action space can make better use of the network and buffer by providing more diverse experiences.

### 5. Network Architecture Adjustments
- **What We’ll Do**: Modify the neural network by:
  - Increasing the input layer from its current size to 64 neurons.
  - Increasing the hidden layer to 32 neurons.
  - Switching from ReLU to LeakyReLU activation.
- **Why It Helps**:
  - **Larger Network Capacity**: A small network (e.g., 16 input neurons, 8 hidden) may lack the representational power to model complex environments, like driving with multiple inputs (speed, position, obstacles). Expanding to 64 input and 32 hidden neurons increases the number of parameters, allowing the network to capture more intricate patterns and relationships.
  - **LeakyReLU Activation**: ReLU outputs zero for negative inputs, which can cause “dying neurons” that stop learning if they get stuck in that range. LeakyReLU introduces a small slope (e.g., 0.01) for negative inputs, ensuring all neurons remain active and contribute gradients, even if their output is negative.
  - **Improved Gradient Flow**: LeakyReLU helps gradients propagate better through the network, especially in deeper or larger architectures, preventing vanishing gradients that could stall learning.
- **How It Solves Each Problem**:
  - **Small Network Capacity**: Directly increases the network’s ability to handle complex tasks, overcoming limitations of the smaller architecture.
  - **Plateauing Performance**: A more capable network can learn better policies, breaking through performance ceilings imposed by insufficient capacity.
  - **Stuck in a Local Maximum**: Greater representational power can help the network distinguish subtle differences in states, potentially identifying better actions to escape suboptimal regions.
  - **Lack of Exploration**: While not directly tied to exploration, a larger network can better evaluate the outcomes of explored actions, making exploration more effective.
  - **Q-Value Overestimation**: A larger network might reduce overestimation by fitting the Q-function more accurately, though this depends on other factors like Double DQN.
  - **Limited Action Space, Small Replay Buffer**: Doesn’t directly address these, but enhances the network’s ability to process available data and actions.

### 6. Alternative Approaches
- **What We’ll Do**: Experiment with additional modifications:
  - **Activation Functions**: Test Tanh, Sigmoid, or ELU instead of ReLU or LeakyReLU.
  - **Reward Equation**: Explore SARSA or Dueling DQN as alternatives to standard DQN.
- **Why It Helps**:
  - **Activation Functions**:
    - **Tanh**: Outputs values between -1 and 1, providing bounded Q-values that might stabilize training in environments with extreme rewards. It’s symmetric around zero, which can help center the network’s outputs.
    - **Sigmoid**: Outputs between 0 and 1, potentially useful if Q-values need a probabilistic interpretation, though it risks vanishing gradients for large inputs.
    - **ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**: Similar to LeakyReLU, but with an exponential curve for negative inputs, it can improve convergence by pushing means toward zero and avoiding dead neurons.
    - These alternatives offer different trade-offs in gradient flow, output range, and robustness, potentially better suiting our specific problem.
  - **Reward Equation**:
    - **SARSA**: An on-policy method that updates Q-values based on the action actually taken, rather than the maximum next-state Q-value (as in DQN). This can reduce overestimation by grounding updates in real behavior, though it may learn more conservatively.
    - **Dueling DQN**: Splits the Q-network into two streams: one for the state value (V) and one for action advantages (A), recombined to produce Q-values. This separation can improve value estimation by focusing learning on state importance versus action benefits, potentially leading to more robust policies.
- **How It Solves Each Problem**:
  - **Plateauing Performance**: Better activation functions or architectures (e.g., Dueling DQN) can enhance learning efficiency, pushing performance higher.
  - **Q-Value Overestimation**: SARSA reduces overestimation by avoiding max operations, while Dueling DQN refines value estimates, both tackling this issue directly.
  - **Lack of Exploration**: SARSA’s on-policy nature might encourage safer exploration, though it’s less aggressive than DQN’s off-policy approach.
  - **Stuck in a Local Maximum**: Dueling DQN’s improved value estimation can highlight better actions, while alternative activations might help the network escape via different gradient dynamics.
  - **Small Network Capacity**: Dueling DQN effectively increases capacity by specializing network components, while activation changes optimize existing capacity.
  - **Limited Action Space, Small Replay Buffer**: These don’t directly expand action space or buffer size, but improve how the model uses what’s available.

## Ongoing Efforts and Challenges

We’ve taken steps to implement several of these potential solutions to address the identified problems and improve our model’s performance. Here’s what we tried and the challenges we encountered:

- **Implemented Solutions**:
  - **Switched to LeakyReLU**: Replaced ReLU to prevent dead neurons and improve gradient flow.
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusted epsilon decay to 0.997, raised minimum epsilon to 0.05, and lowered the learning rate to 0.0005 to enhance exploration and stabilize updates.
  - **Double DQN**: Added a target network to reduce Q-value overestimation and improve training stability.
  - **Increased Network Size**: Expanded the input layer to 64 neurons and the hidden layer to 32 neurons to boost capacity.
  - **Added a “BRAKE” Action**: Increased the action space from 3 to 4 discrete actions to provide more control.

- **Initial Observations**:
  During early training runs, these changes showed promising signs of improvement. For instance:
  - Rewards increased slightly, suggesting the model was learning better policies.
  - The agent crashed less often, possibly due to the “BRAKE” action and better Q-value estimates from Double DQN.
  - Exploration seemed more effective, with the agent trying a wider variety of actions, likely thanks to the tuned epsilon parameters.

- **Major Challenge: Increased Training Time**:
  However, these enhancements came at a significant cost. The combination of a larger network (more neurons to compute), an extra action (larger output layer and more Q-value calculations), and Double DQN (additional network updates) drastically slowed down each training step. What previously took hours now stretched into days, and we couldn’t complete the full training within our available time window. While the improvements were visible in the early stages, they weren’t fully realized because we had to halt the process prematurely.

- **Lessons Learned and Next Steps**:
  This experience highlighted a critical trade-off between model complexity and training efficiency. To move forward, we’re considering optimization strategies such as:
  - **Hardware Acceleration**: Using GPUs or TPUs to speed up computations.
  - **Efficient Libraries**: Switching to a more optimized neural network framework to reduce overhead.
  - **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Focusing the replay buffer on high-value transitions to accelerate learning within the same time frame.
  Despite the setback, we’re encouraged by the initial progress and remain committed to refining these solutions. This journey has underscored the importance of balancing sophistication with practicality, and we’re eager to see the full potential of these changes with further optimization.
